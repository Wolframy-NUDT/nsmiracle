This directory contains sample tcl scripts to be used with nsmiracle. 
These scripts are to be executed as standard ns tcl scripts 
(e.g., 'ns test.tcl')

A few notes:

- some scripts require command line arguments. In this case, if you
run the script without arguments a brief message will tell you which
arguments must be provided

- some scripts require the dei80211mr package to be run. This must be
installed separately, and the libdei80211mr.so library must be in your
library search path (e.g., installed in a standard location or - more
likely - in a directory which you added to the variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
