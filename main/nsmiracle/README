Tutorial for building the ns-Miracle modules from the signet svn distribution

-------------
 Quick start
-------------

1) run  './autogen.sh'

2) assuming that you have ns-allinone installed in PATH, 
   run './configure  --with-ns-allinone=PATH', optionally using
   something like '--prefix=/locale/username' if you 
   intend to run 'make install'

3) run 'make'

4) if you configured with --prefix, or if you are allowed to su root, you can type 'make install'

 More details
--------------

1) ns-allinone

ns-allinone is required to build the ns-Miracle library. 
You are expected to specify the path to the ns-allinone installation
using the --with-ns-allinone options to './configure'.

Current version was tested with ns-2.29 with patches by Federico
Maguolo (maguolof@dei.unipd.it). Please note that you must not only
unpack the ns-allinone source and patch it, but also run 'install'.  
This is because the install process places some header files in
'ns-allinone-2.29/include' which are needed to build the ns-Miracle
library.



2) I just built the module with 'make'. Where the hell is it???

After you run 'make', you can find both static (.a) and shared (.so)
libraries in 'lib/.libs' (the .libs subdir is automatically added by
libtool). 
If you run 'make install', all libraries are by default installed in
/usr/local/lib. Since in many systems installing in that path requires
root privileges, you might want to specify a different path, by using
either the '--prefix' or '--libdir' switch. Please run './configure
--help' for further info
.

3) Test suites

Some test routines are provided, which can be built and run routines
with 'make check'.
