TODO LIST

- Put VoIP functionality currently in CBR module into a new VoIP
module which inherits from CBR module

- UMTS PHY SIRtarget_ at the BS is per-phy but should actually be per-user. 

- UMTS outer loop power control should be implemented to cope with PC
  granularity and eventual PC inefficacy with high mobility

- UMTS PowerControl table should be indexed by code_id and not by rlc_id


- Should find a default interface for CBR and TCP module to set
destination address and port. Currently, CBR uses "$module set
destAddr_", while tcp modules requires "tcpagent set dst_addr_".

- Check broadcast address in IpRouting and IpInterface

- Should fix "defaultGateway" command in iprouting, it somehow causes
the actual gateway to consider packets as being destinated to itself
(which is not true if it's a gateway which is supposed to forward
them).

- merge IP module implementations by Nicola and Federico

- Module/WirelessCh has a bug in getting influenced nodes. 
This can be reproduced running e.g. 
complex_mixed_wireless_wired_static_routing.tcl 
using Module/WirelessCh instead of Module/DumbWirelessCh
The bug is that some endless loop occurs while getting the list of
influenced nodes using even fixed node positions.
Do we *really* need to send messages only to nodes within a range
determined by CSTresh? This breaks how interference is calculated in
dei80211mr. 
Temporary fix: don't use Module/WirelessCh, use Module/DumbWirelessCh
instead, it requires a higher computational load since even
transmissions from very far nodes are considered for reception,
however 1) it works and 2) it probides correct interference calculation
NOTE: WirelessCh implementation in dei80211mr has fixed this issue, we
should update also Module/WirelessCh accordingly

- ARP for "high" IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1) causes some bit/byte
to be dropped in the sender address, check it out

- Check default values for 802.11 (both standard ns 802.11 and
dei80211mr), such as:
- antenna height for two-ray-ground
- noise power
- CSthreshold
- CWmin/CWmax
- Retry Limit
